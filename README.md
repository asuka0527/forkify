# Forkify Project

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the food2fork API to fetch and display recipe food data. 
In this app we also used the MVC Architecture as well as modern JavaScript tools, such as Parcel to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and modify the servings to get the actual amount of ingredients needed.


## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
```
$ npm install
```
## Run parcel in production mode:
```
$ npm run build
```
